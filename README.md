Notes

I have deployed this project on Heroku so you can easily see my work. 
Here is the link: https://fathomless-waters-19692.herokuapp.com/


I have made a dashboard that gets data from the ghibli API that was specified in the assignment.
It is possible to sort the movies on the dashboard.
    Since i get data from an API i can sort by more interesting stuff like Rotten Tomatoes score.

It is possible to get a detailed view of each movie. 
    This gives access to information like rotten tomatoes score, director and producer.

Considerations

I have purposely avoided to use a database because i wanted to focus on other features and functionality listed in the assignment.
    I have however set up the application so that it is easy to add a database. This would allow for more features like comments or notes.

Instead of a list of movies i have created a dashboard that shows each movie in Bootstrap Card. 
    This makes it easier to show more data without the UI being too overwhelming. 
    This also makes it easier to make the design responsive.

Tools and libraries

I choose to use NodeJS with Express as a server because this is what i have most experience with. 
    This stack also makes it easy to deploy and maintain code on Heroku
I choose ejs as a template engine because it is easy and fast to set up.
I use Bootstrap to make the application responsive for all platforms.
