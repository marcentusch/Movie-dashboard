Notes

I have deployed this project on Heroku so you have easy access to my work.

I have developed a dashboard that receives data from the ghibli API, which was specified in the assignment. Since I get data from an API, it is possible to sort the movies on the dashboard by more interesting data such as Rotten Tomatoes score.

I have made it possible to get a detailed view of each movie which gives access to information such as rotten tomatoes score, director and producers.

Considerations
I have purposely avoided to use a database since I wanted to focus on other features and functionality listed in the assignment. However, I have set up the application so that it is easy to add a database. This would allow for more features such as comments or notes.


Instead of a list of movies I have created a dashboard which shows each movie in a Bootstrap Card. This makes it easier to show more data without the UI being too overwhelming. This also makes it easier to make the design responsive. (skide godt!)

Tools and libraries
I chose to use NodeJS with Express as a server since this is what I have the most experience with. This stack also makes it easy to deploy and maintain code on Heroku.

I chose ejs as a template engine because it is easy and fast to set up. 

I have used Bootstrap to make the application responsive for all platforms.
